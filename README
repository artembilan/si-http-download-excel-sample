Sample demonstrates Web Application with one functionality:
Excel file downloading as byte[] and 'Content-Type' HTTP Response header with value 'application/vnd.ms-excel'.
Server logic builded on Spring Integration:
1. File is readed from Classpath with org.springframework.core.io.ClassPathResource
2. Converted into byte[] via org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils
3. byte[] is placed as Message payload via <transformer> inside the <chain>
4. 'Content-Type' is added into MessageHeaders via <header-enricher>
5. HttpRequest is processed by <http:inbound-gateway>

Build System is Gradle and applies 'jetty' plugin
To test this sample it is enough to run Gradle task 'jettyRunWar'.
Jetty Servlet container will be started on defaoult port 8080.
Application context-root is the same a project name.

Important:
	Only the Microsoft IE can open Excel sheet immediately in the Browser window
